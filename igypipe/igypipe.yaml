## IgY-Pipe configuration

library_name:

# Choose 'human', 'mouse' or 'rhesus_monkey'
species: rhesus_monkey


# How many iterations to run the pipeline when discovering new V genes.
iterations: 1


# Filter out merged reads that are shorter than this length.
minimum_merged_read_length: 300


# Length of the random barcode sequence, assumed to be in the beginning of each
# sequence. Set to 0 when you have no random barcode.
barcode_length: 0


## Primer-related settings

# If set to true, it is assumed that the forward primer is always at the 5' end
# of the first read and that the reverse primer is always at the 5' end of the
# second read. If it can also be the other way, set this to false.
# This setting has no effect if no primer sequences are defined below.
stranded: false

# List of 5' primers
forward_primers:
# - AGCTACAGAGTCCCAGGTCCA
# - ACAGGYGCCCACTCYSAG
# - TTGCTMTTTTAARAGGTGTCCAGTGTG
# - CTCCCAGATGGGTCCTGTC
# - ACCGTCCYGGGTCTTGTC
# - CTGTTCTCCAAGGGWGTCTSTG
# - CATGGGGTGTCCTGTCACA


# List of 3' primers
reverse_primers:
# - GCAGGCCTTTTTGGCCNNNNNGCCGATGGGCCCTTGGTGGAGGCTGA  # IgG
# - GCAGGCCTTTTTGGCCNNNNNGGGGCATTCTCACAGGAGACGAGGGGGAAAAG  # IgM


# Work only on this number of reads (for quick test runs). Set to false to
# process all reads.

# limit: false


## Advanced settings (usually do not need to be changed)


# Read merging program. Choose either 'pear' or 'flash'.
# pear merges more reads, but is slower.

# merge_program: pear


# Which program to use for computing multiple alignments. This is used for
# computing consens sequences.
# Choose 'mafft', 'clustalo', 'muscle' or 'muscle-fast'.
# 'muscle-fast' runs muscle with parameters "-maxiters 1 -diags".

# multialign_program: muscle-fast


# Maximum overlap (-M) for the flash read merger.
# If you use pear, this is ignored.

# flash_maximum_overlap: 300


# When clustering sequences to discover new genes, subsample to this number of
# sequences. Higher is slower.

# subsample: 1000


# Which program to use for clustering. Use vsearch or usearch (can also be an
# absolute path).

# cluster_program: vsearch


# Filter out reads that have more than this number of expected errors.
# Set to null to disable.

# maximum_expected_errors: null
# maximum_expected_errors: 5
